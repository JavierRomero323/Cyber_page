        <p><strong> <i>A government watchdog hacked a US federal agency to stress-test its cloud security
        </i></strong>
        <p class="side">A U.S. government watchdog stole more than 1GB of seemingly sensitive personal data from the cloud systems of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The good news: The data was fake and part of a series of tests to check whether the Department’s cloud infrastructure was secure.
          “Let me start by kind of explaining that with an example. In India recently, it has become a requirement, in order to obtain a SIM card, to submit to a biometric facial recognition scan. That is not just happening in India, we’re seeing a number of jurisdictions where to obtain a phone number, you are required to provide more and more personal information. Some, in some places like Taiwan, that is linked to a government ID databases that often get breached and cause a lot of problems,” she said.

        The U.S. National Security Agency has confirmed that hackers exploiting flaws in Ivanti’s widely used enterprise VPN appliance have targeted organizations across the U.S. defense sector.
        NSA spokesperson Edward Bennett confirmed in an emailed statement to TechCrunch on Friday that the U.S. intelligence agency, along with its interagency counterparts, is “tracking and aware of the broad impact from the recent exploitation of Ivanti products, to include of the [sic] U.S defense sector.”
        “The [NSA’s] Cybersecurity Collaboration Center continues to work with our partners to detect and mitigate this activity,” the spokesperson adde</p>

The Department of the Interior manages the country’s federal land, national parks and a budget of billions of dollars, and hosts a significant amount of data in the cloud.
According to the report, in order to test whether the Department of the Interior’s cloud infrastructure was secure, the OIG used an online tool called Mockaroo to create fake personal data that “would appear valid to the Department’s security tools.”
The OIG team then used a virtual machine inside the Department’s cloud environment to imitate “a sophisticated threat actor” inside of its network, and subsequently used “well-known and widely documented techniques to exfiltrate data.”
